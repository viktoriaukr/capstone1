## Proposal 1
### Music Discovery Platform

   Idea: create an application using a music API, like SoundCloudeAPI, that will allow users to find music they like based on their favorite genres or artists. (Inspired by Spotify).



## Proposal 2
### Recipe finder

  Idea: this application would be useful for people who like to cook. It would allow users to find yummy recipes based on user input or preferences. I would use Food API.(https://spoonacular.com/food-api)


## Proposal 3
###  Book lover

  Idea: As a book lover, I know how hard it is to find a book you want to read, especially knowing how many books are out there. I thought it would be cool to build an app where you would be able to find what you like based on artists, genres, or previously read books. (I was also thinking that it would be cool to make a quiz for the user that would give a random book after the user took a quiz).
  I'm thinking about 2 APIs that I could use:  1. Open Library API, 2. Amazon Books API (I would be able to direct users to Amazon where they can buy books that they are interested in).
